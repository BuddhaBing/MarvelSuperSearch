## The Brief

The task here is to build a simple web app that allows you to search for something and then select a result to view. The initial screen should provide a simple input for users to input their search term (think typeahead) and clicking on a result should take you to a new page with details of the item clicked.

What you search for is up to you, please feel free to use any data set (or dummy data).

Feel free to use whatever technology you feel most comfortable with or think is most appropriate.
